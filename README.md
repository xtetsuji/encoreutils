# encoreutils README

## What is this?

**encoreutils**. This is more utility of [GNU *coreutils*](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html).

## Concept

I want more utility of *coreutils*.
E.g. elegant move and unlink, wise formatter, CLI colorizer, and so on.

In almost POSIX environment, Perl (command line `perl`) is installed already.
We are cheered perl flexibility on many POSIX server operation.
And I like Perl.

Because I write some additional **encourage** *coreutils* utility by Perl.

I name the utilities group **encoreutils** (en(-courage) + coreutils).

Almost *encoreutils* scripts are written by Perl,
Moreover they require perl-5.8 or perl-5.10 at least version
without any non-core CPAN modules (perl-5.x core modules only!)
for strict portability.
